        "description": "huge\n\nyeah so if you didnt know celeste is a fire game so everyone go play it NOW! also get it on steam and hook up a controller to your pc thats the best way to play \n\nok so the moon berry: its a secret ending to farewell, the last main level of celeste. you have to do the regular last room, then after you hit the electric box you backtrack on tiny platforms left over and eventually make your way to the real last room. im sure there's a clip of me somewhere doing the whole backtracking thing but idk. this video is my completion of the last secret room.\n\nabout the jump: i have an extended variant (mod in celeste modding that literally everyone has) that lets me jump infinitely. i was using it to test something completely different and forgot to turn it off when i was done, but the one instance i jumped where i normally shouldn't have been was right next to that wall in the middle. im 99% sure if i had the mod off i would have buffered the wall jump and survived so i think i'm fine, but if i get too much flack about it i'll try doing it again. whatever, just another excuse for me to play this game again thanks :D\n\noh and another thing: i didn't get the achievement. a few months ago i was testing farewell in debug mode and accidentally collected the moon berry, which was fine since i was playing on a separate file, but steam achievements sync across all files so i got the achievement. \nsteam thinks i got the achievement on Sept 2nd, 2023\ni actually did it on Oct 3rd, 2023",

          "description": "huge\n\nyeah so if you didnt know celeste is a fire game so everyone go play it NOW! also get it on steam and hook up a controller to your pc thats the best way to play \n\nok so the moon berry: its a secret ending to farewell, the last main level of celeste. you have to do the regular last room, then after you hit the electric box you backtrack on tiny platforms left over and eventually make your way to the real last room. im sure there's a clip of me somewhere doing the whole backtracking thing but idk. this video is my completion of the last secret room.\n\nabout the jump: i have an extended variant (mod in celeste modding that literally everyone has) that lets me jump infinitely. i was using it to test something completely different and forgot to turn it off when i was done, but the one instance i jumped where i normally shouldn't have been was right next to that wall in the middle. im 99% sure if i had the mod off i would have buffered the wall jump and survived so i think i'm fine, but if i get too much flack about it i'll try doing it again. whatever, just another excuse for me to play this game again thanks :D\n\noh and another thing: i didn't get the achievement. a few months ago i was testing farewell in debug mode and accidentally collected the moon berry, which was fine since i was playing on a separate file, but steam achievements sync across all files so i got the achievement. \nsteam thinks i got the achievement on Sept 2nd, 2023\ni actually did it on Oct 3rd, 2023"
